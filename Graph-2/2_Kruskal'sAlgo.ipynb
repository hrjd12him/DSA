    "Implemention of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. It takes a list of edges, where each edge is represented by its source vertex, destination vertex, and weight, and then it finds the MST and prints its edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how the code works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `Edge` class is defined to represent an edge with source (`src`), destination (`dest`), and weight (`wt`) attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `getparent` function is a helper function used to find the parent of a vertex in a set. It utilizes a parent array to keep track of the parent of each vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `Kruskal` function is the main implementation of Kruskal's algorithm. It takes a list of edges and the number of vertices (`noVertices`) as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - It initializes a parent array where each vertex is its own parent initially.\n",
    "   - It sorts the edges based on their weights in ascending order.\n",
    "   - It initializes a count variable to keep track of the number of edges added to the MST and an empty list `output` to store the MST edges.\n",
    "   - It iterates through the sorted edges and checks if adding the current edge (`curr_edge`) to the MST would create a cycle by comparing the parents of the source and destination vertices. If adding the edge doesn't create a cycle, it adds the edge to the MST, updates the count, and updates the parent array to merge the two connected components.\n",
    "   - It continues this process until the MST has `noVertices - 1` edges (since an MST for `n` vertices has `n-1` edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Input is taken from the user, where the first line contains the number of vertices and edges, and subsequent lines contain the source, destination, and weight of each edge. The edges are created as `Edge` objects and stored in the `edges` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `Kruskal` function is called with the input edges and number of vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, the edges of the MST are printed, and the output is formatted so that the source vertex is always less than the destination vertex.\n"
