    "In computer science and data structures, a \"stack\" is a fundamental and widely used linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a collection of items stacked on top of each other, where you can only add or remove items from the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key operations associated with a stack data structure are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Push:** This operation adds an item to the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pop:** This operation removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Peek (or Top):** This operation retrieves the item from the top of the stack without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Is Empty:** Checks whether the stack is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks are often used in various applications, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function Call Stack:** In programming languages like C, C++, and others, a stack is used to manage function calls and their respective return addresses during program execution. This is crucial for maintaining the order of function execution and handling function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expression Evaluation:** Stacks are used to evaluate arithmetic expressions, such as infix, postfix, or prefix expressions. They help in converting expressions to a form that can be easily computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backtracking Algorithms:** Stacks are used in various algorithms that involve backtracking, such as depth-first search in graph traversal or solving puzzles like the Tower of Hanoi.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Undo Operations:** Stacks can be used to implement undo functionality in applications where you need to reverse a series of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Browser History:** Browsers use stacks to keep track of visited web pages, enabling users to navigate forward and backward in their browsing history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks are efficient for these applications because they provide constant-time complexity (O(1)) for push, pop, and peek operations when implemented with an array or a linked list. However, it's important to manage the stack size to avoid potential stack overflow errors in some cases."
