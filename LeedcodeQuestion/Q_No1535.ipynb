    "\n",
    "Given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.\n",
    "\n",
    "A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. arr[0] and arr[1]). In each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains at position 0, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the integer which will win the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: Let's see the rounds of the game:\n",
    "Round |       arr       | winner | win_count\n",
    "  1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1\n",
    "  2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1\n",
    "  3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1\n",
    "  4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2\n",
    "So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: arr = [3,2,1], k = 10\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.\n",
