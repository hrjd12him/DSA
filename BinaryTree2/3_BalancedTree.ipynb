    "A balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by no more than 1. In other words, the tree is approximately balanced, and this balance helps to ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of balanced binary trees, with the most common ones being AVL trees and Red-Black trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AVL Trees:**\n",
    "   - AVL trees are binary search trees where the balance factor of each node is always -1, 0, or 1.\n",
    "   - The balance factor of a node is the height of its left subtree minus the height of its right subtree.\n",
    "   - If the balance factor is outside the range [-1, 0, 1], the tree is rebalanced through rotation operations.\n",
    "   - AVL trees guarantee logarithmic height, which ensures efficient search, insert, and delete operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Red-Black Trees:**\n",
    "   - Red-Black trees are binary search trees with additional properties that ensure balance.\n",
    "   - Each node is assigned a color (either red or black), and the tree is subjected to five properties:\n",
    "     - Every node is either red or black.\n",
    "     - The root is black.\n",
    "     - Every leaf (NIL) is black.\n",
    "     - If a node is red, then both its children are black.\n",
    "     - Every simple path from a node to its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes.\n",
    "   - The color property ensures that the longest path from the root to a leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced trees are important in the context of search trees because they guarantee that the height of the tree remains logarithmic in relation to the number of nodes. This logarithmic height ensures efficient search, insertion, and deletion times, making balanced trees suitable for a variety of applications, including databases and other data structures where efficient access and modification operations are crucial."
