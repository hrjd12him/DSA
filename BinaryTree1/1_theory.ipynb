    "**Binary Tree:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition:** A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Root Node:** The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root node. It is the starting point for traversing the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Internal Node:** A node that has one or more child nodes is called an internal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Leaf Node:** A node that has no children is called a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parent Node:** The node that has child nodes is referred to as the parent node of those child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Child Node:** A node directly connected to another node in the direction away from the root is referred to as the child node of that parent node.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Depth of a Node:** The depth of a node in a binary tree is the length of the path from the root node to that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Height of a Tree:** The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Binary Trees:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Full Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. It means that every level of the tree is completely filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complete Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right. It's used in heap data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Perfect Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Balanced Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differs by at most one. It ensures that the tree remains relatively balanced, facilitating efficient operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary Tree Traversal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inorder Traversal (LNR):** Visit the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preorder Traversal (NLR):** Visit the root node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Postorder Traversal (LRN):** Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Level Order Traversal:** Visit nodes level by level, starting from the root and moving left to right within each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** Adding a new node to the binary tree according to specific rules (e.g., smaller values to the left, larger values to the right in a binary search tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletion:** Removing a node from the binary tree while maintaining the tree's integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Search:** Finding a specific node in the tree, often used to locate a particular value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Traversal:** Visiting all nodes in the tree in a specific order, as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Balancing:** In the context of binary search trees, balancing operations ensure that the tree remains balanced, improving the efficiency of search and insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary trees are fundamental in computer science and have various applications, including binary search trees (BSTs) for efficient searching, expression trees for evaluating mathematical expressions, and more complex data structures like AVL trees and red-black trees for maintaining balanced structures. Understanding binary trees is essential for mastering many computer science concepts and algorithms."
